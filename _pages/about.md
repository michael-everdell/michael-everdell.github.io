I am interested in syntax, semantics, and the syntax-semantics interface. In particular, my work explores the lexical semantic properties of words and roots that serve as the basis for morphological and syntactic processes. I focus especially on questions of argument realization and verbal valency augmentation. I use theoretically engaged fieldwork on the Southern Tepehuan languages (Tepiman < Uto-Aztecan) of Durango, Mexico to both document the languages and explore broader cross-linguistic questions. I am also involved in the revitalization of the languages and cultures of the [Opatan peoples](https://opatanation.org/). 

I am currently a Lecturer in the Department of Linguistics at Boston University.

My pronouns are he/him.
